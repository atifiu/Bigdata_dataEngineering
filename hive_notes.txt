Managed tables vs external tables

In managed tables, data is fully managed by hive. Hive owns the file and directories. Delting the tabler will delete file and metdata
External tables are shared by Hadoop and Hadoop ecosystem such as spark. deleting the table will only delete metadata but file data will reside in hadoop

create table if not exists scorecards

hadoop fs -ls /user/hive/warehouse to explote hadoop filesystem where fs is filesystem from command line

Number of files in hadoop table is equal to number of insert statements

hadoop fs -ls /user/hive/warehouse --hive metastore

# make a directory and named it as data
hadoop fs -mkdir /data

# copy the csv file that we have created in to this folder
hadoop fs -copyFromLocal courses.csv /data/

# if we access in to the data folder we will see courses.csv file is there
hadoop fs -ls /data/

describe formatted table_name to check if table is managed or external
